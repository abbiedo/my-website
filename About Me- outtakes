About Me
<br>My interest in <em>piyyut</em> began when I spent a year in Israel after high school. My family hadn't sung many zemirot when I was growing up (and I probably would not have wanted them to at the time), but spending every Shabbat in a different place with family and friends showed me new ways to appreciate Shabbat, including with zemirot. <br>
		 I spent the following summer memorizing some of my new favorite zemirot and listening to shiurim about the meaning and sources behind these zemirot. The shiurim by Rabbi Alan Haber <a href="http://www.yutorah.org/search/?s=zemirot&teacher=81782&sort=1"> available on YU Torah</a> were especially interesting and helpful. <br>
		 In my second semester in college, I led a chabura (student study group) focusing on zemirot and piyyutim and their biblical sources and references. The chabura was called "Zemirot, Shirot, V'Tishbachot" and met for three semesters. In my sophomore year I took a class about Spanish Hebrew poets and poems (from 500 to 1500) which increased my knowledge about and appreciation for piyyutim.
